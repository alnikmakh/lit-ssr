// You might also import and define your root component here if needed,
// but often just importing the hydration support is enough for Lit elements
// defined elsewhere (like in index.html or loaded via other scripts).

// Example: If my-element wasn't loaded by index.html directly:
// import '../my-element.js';

console.log('Hydration support loaded.');
